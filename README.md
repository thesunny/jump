## Installation

To install this extension, copy the entire diretory into

`~/.vscode/extensions`

After restarting vscode, the extension should work

## Developing

To work on this extension, you can start the extension running in a special
debug version of vscode by pressing `f5`.

To see the debug console, press `ctrl+backtick` (which I can't type because
the backtick character is reserved in markdown)
